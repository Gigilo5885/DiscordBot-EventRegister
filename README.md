## Event Registration Bot
> This is a Discord bot that connects to Google Sheets and allows users to register for events by entering commands in Discord. The purpose of this project is to practice Python and the development process while creating a convenient event registration system.

## Motivation

When organizing LARP (劇本殺) events, it is important to manage the number of participants, especially when there are gender restrictions or limited spots available. The existing registration methods have become chaotic as the number of events increased. To address this issue, this Discord bot enables users to directly register and check the status of events in a Discord channel.

## Planned Features

- User registration: Users can register their information.
- Event management: Admins can create and modify events, including event name, description, and available slots.
- Event registration: Users can sign up for events.
- Notification: The bot will notify users when an event has enough participants to proceed.
- Registration status check: Users can check the current registration status of events.
- Regular reminders: The bot will periodically send reminders in the channel for upcoming events.

## Progress

- March 8, 2024: Started development of the event registration system.
- March 7, 2024: Completed user registration and information modification (name/gender) functionality.
- March 4, 2024: Initiated the project and brainstormed the requirements.

Please note that the project is still under development, and this README file will be updated with more information as progress is made.
